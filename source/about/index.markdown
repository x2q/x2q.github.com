Hi,

I created x2q.net to help myself organizing my `notes to self`. Hopefully the stuff is useful to others as well.

I enjoy solving problems, and research into wierd things and problems.

Current research (read: things I try to understand):

* Online payments (and to some extent offline payments - POS)
* Big Data, fraud detection and preventation using Hadoop etc.
* Cracking/Hacking crypto stuff
* Alternative payments, bitcoin etc.

You may email me: x2q `[at]` x2q `[dot]` net
